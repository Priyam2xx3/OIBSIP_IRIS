# Iris Flower Prediction 🌸

This project is an **Iris Flower Prediction** model developed during my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The objective of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*) based on features like petal and sepal length and width.

## 📌 Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Model building and training (using classification algorithms)
* Model evaluation and testing

## 📁 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [(https://github.com/Priyam2xx3/OIBSIP_IRIS)]
   ```

2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Iris_Flower_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

3. Run all cells to see the complete workflow.

## 📊 Dataset

The classic Iris dataset includes 150 samples with features for each flower.
The datase is available in Kaggle

## ✅ Results

The model can classify iris flowers with high accuracy using simple machine learning algorithms.
